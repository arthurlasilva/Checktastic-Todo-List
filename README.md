This project is a study I've made utilizing React and Material UI - MUI.

Since it was a study project, it is lacking a save state that stores the data you have inputed in local storage/cookies.

This project has helped me get a better grasp of React and how to use libraries within the code.

I intend on revisiting this project in the future and add some new features to make it more on par with what we have on Google Keep or Evernote.
